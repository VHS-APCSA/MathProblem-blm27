# MathProblem
The goal of this project is to write code that solves a math problem 
from the math class you're currently in or one you took last year.
Specifications:
Your math problem must use at least two classes that work together
and a thrid runner class that demonstrates how they work.

I have included the example for Line and Point that we did in class.
